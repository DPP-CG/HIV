%% NOTE : CODE till 13/06/17
% code is not consistent in names with the previous code, have to make
% thode changes.

%% Desription:
% following code is based on the two-step markov model developed by Prof.
% Chaitra G et. al. for parameterization of cancer state transition for
% LMIC (low and middle income countries).

% The whole model is split into two sub-models, first for calculation of
% onset rate and second for calculating the rate of diagnosis

%% MODEL 1:
% model 1 is a stochastic process {Yt: t>=0}, defined over state space as
% follows,
% s = { Ha, Ua, Da, M }, H, U, D and M stands for Healthy state,
% Undiagnosed state, Diagnosed state and Mortal state respectively; 'a'
% stands for age. TPM cam be referred from the paper

% Aim of model 1: Calculation of onset rate for each value of 'a' (age)

% Overview of algorithm of model 1:
% STEP 1: initialization step
% STEP 2: calculation of P_haua and onset rate from that value
% STEP 3: calculation of P_steady state_ua-1
% STEP 4: calculation of P_steady state_ha
% STEP 5: increment of a by 1, if a<a_max go to step 2, else stop

%% inputs needed for the algorithm
% 1. incidence estimates, inci
% 2. fraction of population in age 'a', c
% 3. fraction of population not living with disease diagnosed, i.e either
% healthy or i undiagnosed state, A
% 4. age matrix
% 5. p_steady_u at age zero
% 6. p_steady_h at age zero
% 7. A at age zero
% 8. transition rate from H to D
% 9. mortality rate from D to M
% 10. Probability of transition from H to U at age zero
